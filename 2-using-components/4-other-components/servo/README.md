# Using servo motor with the Arduino

## Usability
How to control a standard servo motor, to go back and forth across 180 degrees, using a for `loop()`. This is done with the help of the Servo library, which is pre-installed library in the Arduino IDE.

## Requirements
- Arduino board
- Micro servo

## Steps
- Using the Arduino IDE, flash the code ([servo.ino](https://github.com/estape11/arduino-workshop/blob/main/2-using-components/4-other-components/servo/servo.ino))
- Monitor the servo that goes from 0 degrees to 180 degrees and back to 0 degrees
