# Using a 7 segment display with Arduino

## Usability
One digit seven segment displays are used in many embedded system and industrial applications where the range of outputs to be shown is known beforehand. Basic 1 digit seven segment display can show numbers from 0-9 and a few characters. 

## Requirements
- 7 Segment LED Display, InfoVue
- 200 ohm resistor
- Arduino board
- Breadboard

## Steps
- Using the Arduino IDE, flash the code ([7segments.ino](https://github.com/estape11/arduino-workshop/blob/main/2-using-components/7segments/7segments.ino))
- Monitor the 7 segment display that goes from 0 to 9 in two seconds steps
