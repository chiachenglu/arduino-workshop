# Using step motor (stepper) with the Arduino

## Usability
They are used in so many everyday items, including window blinds, 3D printers, DVD players, security cameras, and CNC machines. They can rotate continuously like DC motors and be positioned precisely (in discrete steps) like servo motors.

## Requirements
- Arduino board
- 28BYJ-48
- ULN2003 Driver

## Steps
- Using the Arduino IDE, flash the code (step-motor.ino)
- Monitor te motor rotate slow CW and then fast CCW every second
